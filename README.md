# D-IPCR — Digital IPCR System

A Flask + SQL based capstone project implementing the Philippines' **Strategic Performance Management System (SPMS) / Individual Performance Commitment and Review (IPCR)** for an academic college environment.

D-IPCR digitizes the faculty performance cycle; from target cascading through multi-role review, evidence submission, scoring, and printable IPCR.

## What It Does

The system routes faculty performance targets through a **multi-role cascade**:

```
Admin → Dean → Program Chair / RET Chair → Faculty → Review → Lock → Evidence → Scoring → Print
```

### Key Features

- **Cascaded target allocation**- quotas flow down through the institutional hierarchy
- **Multi-stage review pipeline**- RET Chair (If faculty has Research related targets) → Program Chair → Dean approval with item-level feedback
- **IPCR locking**- approved drafts commit to final committed targets
- **Evidence uploads**- per-target PDF evidence with supervisor verification
- **SPMS scoring**- Q/E/T (Quantity/Efficiency/Timeliness) rolled into weighted categories with Final Weighted Rating + Adjectival Rating
- **Printable IPCR**- landscape form matching the official SPMS layout
- **Email notifications**- approval/evidence emails (optional, degrades to console logging when SMTP is unconfigured)
- **Audit trail**- every action logged for accountability
  
## Installation

### Method A: Docker

Requires Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2.

**Step 1 necessary directories and files**

```bash
mkdir dipcr && cd dipcr

# Get docker-compose.yml and .env-example from the repo
# (or download the release assets)
cp .env-example .env
```

**Step 2: `.env` and ```docker-compose.yml```**

Set at minimum these values for env:

```bash
nano .env
```

```env
DB_PASSWORD=user_pass
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
SECRET_KEY=long_string
ADMIN_EMAIL=email@email.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourAdminPassword1!   # 8+ chars, upper, lower, digit, special
```

> Leave `SMTP_HOST` empty to log emails to the console instead of sending.

Customising port for web acces:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```yaml
  web:
    ports:
      - "5000:5000" # Change value the one on the left, left port is the external port for access. The one on the right is the internal port handled by docker. 
```

**Step 3: Starting**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first start pulls the web + database images, applies the schema automatically, and creates the first admin account from env's `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

**Step 4 — Access**

Open `http://localhost:5000` (or `http://<server-ip>:<port>` if you changed the port) and log in with the admin credentials.

**Updating:**

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**Resetting everything (wipes all data (such as SQL)):**

```bash
docker compose down -v # -v flag for deleting every data
docker compose up -d
```

#### Building & Publishing Images (Developer)

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
# Build
docker build -t  username/dipcr-db:latest .
docker build -t username/dipcr-db:latest /db

# Push # requires login for docker registry
docker login
docker push username/dipcr-web:latest
docker push username/dipcr-db:latest
```

> Note: the `db` image bakes in the schema (`db/schema.sql`) — rebuild & push it whenever the schema changes.

### Method B: Local Development

Requires Python 3.10+ and a reachable MySQL 8 instance.

**Step 1 — Clone & install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaspartame/Management-PCR
cd Management-PCR
python -m venv venv

# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2 — Configure `.env`**

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

Point `DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT`/`DB_NAME` at your MySQL instance and set `SECRET_KEY`.

**Step 3 — Run**

```bash
python run.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

**Creating the first Admin (fresh database):**

Registration only *claims* an existing profile, so a brand-new database needs its first account created directly:

```bash
python bootstrap_admin.py
```
